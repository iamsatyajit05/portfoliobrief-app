## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that comes _with_ React Native.

Run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

```bash
# for Android
yarn android

# for iOS
yarn ios
```

With Metro Bundler running in the terminal, press the <kbd>a</kbd> key to launch the app on an Android emulator or the <kbd>i</kbd> key to launch the app on an iOS simulator.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
